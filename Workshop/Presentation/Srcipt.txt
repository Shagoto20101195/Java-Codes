Hello everyone welcome to cse221 video presentation on Palindrome Partitioning.
This is Andalib Rahman Shagoto and my peer ... from the Dept. of CSE, BRACU.
So let's begin

Firstly let us recall a palindrome. We know that a palindrome is a string that reads
the same both front and back. Also another fact for a palindrome is that, the
substring within its first and last character is also a palindrome. So if we look at e.g.

* show 1st one *

The string ... is a palindrome since its back reads the same as well that is ...
also notice that our 2nd condition holds true that the substring "aa" between f & l char
which is also a palindrome.

* show 2nd one *

And for the 2nd e.g the string is not a palindrome since the backward string is ...

Now about Palindrome Partitioning. Palindrome Partitioning is when string's partitioned
is in such a way that every substring is a palindrome. As for our convenience, we will be 
focusing on how we can acheive the minimum partitioning.
